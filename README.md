# Dotfiles

This is a collection of config files and shell scripts that I use.

## Configs

Among other things, this repo contains configs for:

- [calcurse](https://calcurse.org)
- [dunst](https://dunst-project.org/)

- [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd)
- [X](https://www.x.org/wiki/)

## Scripts

Scripts are found in [.local/bin](.local/bin). This collection consists of scripts that I have written myself,
as well as scripts that I copied from other people.

## Usage

This repo is mostly a way for me to backup and share my configs & scripts. Some of the configs are more generic
and can be used directly if you'd like to, others contain individual settings that you'll have to adjust before
using them. I'll leave it up to you, to figure everything out ðŸ˜‰

## Credits

Some of the scripts are copied from [Luke Smith](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/voidrice) and dmenupass was written by [deurzen](https://github.com/deurzen/dmenupass/blob/master/dmenupass).
